A Visual studio plugin that allows compiling C# code into binary/asm for 0x10c DCPU.

Features:
* Create new Visual studio project
* Compile basic c# to:
  - asm
  - bin 
  - exe 
* Emulation using CLI at real speed (plus other speeds) with UI and step/reset controls

ToDo:
* Debugger support (Run programs and debug them via visual studio)
* Object support
* Small standard library
* Auto complete and error checking in Visual Studio
* Network support (running two simulators together)
